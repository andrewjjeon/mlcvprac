4. I also strongly recommend doing mock interviews on https://www.pramp.com/
I find it especially helpful to mock interview as the interviewer, as you get to learn what feelings will be triggered by your behavior as the interviewee, so you know what to do and not do. But, you still definitely want to get your reps in as the interviewee. I also became significantly less nervous during interviews after like 5 or 6 pramp sessions.
